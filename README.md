# Python Game Collection

This repository contains two Python-based mini-games: "Flappy Bird Game" and "Girl Walking Animation." Each game offers a unique experience, with Flappy Bird focusing on navigating obstacles and the Girl Walking Animation providing a simple, interactive character animation.

## Games

### 1. Flappy Bird Game

#### Description
The Flappy Bird Game is a classic arcade-style game where players control a bird trying to fly through gaps in vertical pipes without hitting them. The game applies gravity to the bird, making it more challenging and requiring precise timing to keep the bird in flight.

#### How to Play
- The bird is initially positioned at the center of the screen.
- Use the mouse or keyboard (spacebar) to control the bird's altitude.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground to keep playing.
- Each successful pass through a gap scores a point.

#### Requirements
- Python
- `pgzrun` library for game rendering (`pip install pgzero` if not already installed)

#### Files
- `flappy bird game.py`: Main game file.

### 2. Girl Walking Animation

#### Description
This program displays an animated character walking across the screen. The character's walking movement is created by switching between different frames to simulate a walking animation. The character can also change direction based on the input, making the animation interactive.

#### How to Use
- Run the program to start the animation.
- The character will move continuously across the screen.
- You can control the direction of the character's movement using keyboard inputs.

#### Requirements
- Python
- `pgzrun` library for rendering (`pip install pgzero` if not already installed)

#### Files
- `girl walking program.py`: Main animation file.
